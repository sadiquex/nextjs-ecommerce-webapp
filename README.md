## hey, welcome to my imaginary ecommerce website

### Built with

- Nextjs 14 - for dev
- Styled components + MUI - for styling
- Sanity - for content management
- Redux Toolkit - for state management
- Stripe - for payment gateway

### Stripe payment page

- Card - `4242 4242 4242 4242 (Visa)`

### Continued development

- the issue with the checkout button not working is that, I am managing the cart with state, and trying to hookup stripe's checkout system using a custom hook `redirectToCheckout` from a package `use-shopping-cart`
- add user authentication
